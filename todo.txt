Where did I leave off?


I left off on homework 5:

I still have not completed the model without admixture.

I need to calculate the posterior probabilities (perform inference on k) for each iteration of the gibbs sampler.

That can be used again in the model with admixture also.

The update functions for the algorithm should be working properly.


As for the model with admixture:

The update functions for p and q should be fine, but the update function for z needs work. Ideally, I can also find a way to make it more efficient. Otherwise, it will take an incredibly long time to run (I think).

I also need to program the MH algorithm step to update alpha.



Things still todo for this class:

* Get as far as I can on homework 5
  * How to calculate posterior probabilities?
  * How to sample Q?
  * How to update alpha?
* Start homework 6
* Get as far as I can on homework 6
* Homework 7
