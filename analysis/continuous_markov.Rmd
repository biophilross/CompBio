## Introduction


## Lecture

Continuous time markov chains -> counting processes -> poisson process -> superposition property

### Superposition property

If we have two poisson processes, then we cah superimpose them to make a new poisson process where the rate is equal to the sum of the two individual poisson processes. $N(t)$ ~ $Pois((\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2})t)$

$$
N(t) 
$$

### Thinning property

THe opposite of the superposition property. We can split one poisson process into multiple poisson processes with their own rates.
